# real-time-object-detection-yolo
A real-time object detection project using YOLO and OpenCV for object detection in video streams. This repository demonstrates how to use pre-trained YOLO models with configuration and weight files for detecting objects in real-time video.

Key Features:
- Object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) model.
- Real-time video processing for object detection.
- Customizable configuration for different YOLO models and video sources.
- Save output video with detected objects highlighted.

Dependencies:
- OpenCV (CPU version, no CUDA support).
- Python 3.10+
- YOLO model weights and configuration files (cfg and weights).

Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set the paths for YOLO model cfg and weights files.
4. Run the script to detect objects in real-time and save the output video.

Contributions are welcome!
